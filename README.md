 <h2>Temperature Converter App (React.js)</h2>

This is a simple and user-friendly temperature converter application built using React.js. The app allows users to convert temperatures between different units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The app includes:

<h3> User Input: </h3> Users can enter a temperature value that they wish to convert. 
<h3> Unit Selection: </h3> Two dropdown menus allow users to select the units they want to convert from and to. The available options are Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), and Kelvin (K).
 <h3> Conversion Logic: </h3> The app supports multiple conversion types:
Celsius to Fahrenheit
Fahrenheit to Celsius
Celsius to Kelvin
Kelvin to Celsius
Fahrenheit to Kelvin
Kelvin to Fahrenheit
 <h3> Result Display: </h3>  After selecting the units and inputting a value, the app displays the converted result in the desired unit.
<h3> Responsive Design: </h3> The app is built to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
The app makes use of React State (useState) to manage the result and updates dynamically as the user interacts with the input and selects different units. Tailwind CSS is used for styling and ensuring the app is visually appealing and mobile-friendly.
